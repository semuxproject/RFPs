# RFP: Semux Premine burning strategy
version 2, edited on 06 March 2019
by honeycrypto

## Abstract
Major part of the existing cryptocurrencies have premine, proven insta-mine, funds from ICO, private sales 
or other sources of funding. Despite of that, lately we've seen many announcements from Top-50 projects that 
they have not enough funding for the future development. On the other side, many new projects appearing every 
day with unreasonably high premine with up to 95% of tokens owned by the dev team and small 5% crowdsales.
While such contradictory moves may help projects to succeed in the future, this is more a Kickstarter model and it has nothing to do with crypto fundamentals 
where the decentralisation always mattered. 

Some projects (ie: ETC, RVN and GRIN, but in fact also many others) also tried to ask community for donations on future development. 
And most of them dramatically failed. We should admit that modern crypto community will prefer to see 
how their holdings going to $0 either than donate some share for future development. Also, from the Semux Team side, orogvany has confirmed that most 
part of BFT Pool operators has disabled donations to pool software developers and they leave 100% of pool fees to themselves. 
With all that said, I consider that donations model has completely failed in cryptocurrencies and projects cannot rely on that. 

## Motivation 
Currently, Semux holds a premine of 18.6 million SEM, while the circulating supply is 9.6 million SEM. 
As the Semux Foundation strongly believe in the success of the project, we'd like to burn significant part 
of the premine to reduce risks of the community and enhance the decentralisation.

## Proposal
### SEM = $0.20 USD
#### Development 
On average Semux had 3 permanent and active contributors last year and some occasional contributors who received 
dev bounties per task/project. If we want to maintain 3 developers at $2000 USD per month, we'd need 30K SEM monthly or 360K SEM yearly. 
Occasional contributors can receive another 120K SEM yearly based on their weekly/monthly activity or developed from scratch projects. 
With all that said, at current prices Semux may need up to 480K SEM per year to maintain 3-4 active developers for 1 year. 

TOTAL: **480K SEM per year**

#### Listings 
Community is constantly asking for more exchanges. 
While we have some budget already for tier-3 exchanges (ie: the famous 4.2mil DOTs for Cryptopia), I'll propose to try to get 
listed in Binance DEX considering it a tier-1 exchange. From public AMA with CZ_binance we know that listing in this DEX may cost as high as $100K USD or 500K SEM.

Please note that here is no guarantee neither of listing, nor of the listing fee size. The mentioned choices come from community feedback in our official Discord channel. There is a high chance that Semux won't ever be listed in any of the mentioned above exchanges if they won't live up to our expectations and goals, or if Semux project won't pass their requirements.

Mentioned budget will be used to pay the integration costs of non-standard Semux blockchain of any exchanges ready for partnership with Semux project.

TOTAL: **500K SEM**

#### Marketing 
I'm not informed about any commitments to participate in public conferences and events by anyone in Semux community. 
This proposal doesn't include any possible offline expenses on travelling and accommodation. 

Basic online marketing will require $2K USD monthly or 
**120K SEM per year.** 

Advanced marketing (hire PR team, pay to crypto blogs, magazines, twitters): $6K USD monthly or **360K SEM per year**

#### Semux Developer Program 
Semux tech becomes mature enough and now we need to think about further adoption. For me personally, this is the most exciting goal of our roadmap. I'd like to see Semux Foundation funding up to 10 apps/games/projects to adopt Semux as their main currency. 
With $10K USD per project, this will require up to **500K SEM** budget if we will have enough of submissions that can 
pass our requirements and quality checks.

#### Full code audit at Hacker.one 
We need a $50K USD or **250K SEM** budget for a bounty program at hacker one. In very unlikely case if the number of reported bugs 
will surpass the budget, we can use some reserves from development fund. 

#### Legal Entity 
If Semux Foundation wants to go official to simplify future listings, it may need another $25K - $50K USD for lawyers, business consultants and short-term expenses. 

TOTAL: **250K SEM **

### Worst case scenario Strategy
If there is a 2-3 years longer bear market and SEM goes as low as $0.05 USD (-75% from current price)

- cut the Binance DEX listing
- cut the legal entity (no KYC, no top exchanges)
- lower marketing activity to Social Networks only 
- decrease number of projects participating in Semux Developer Program

I'm pretty sure that if things in crypto will go very bad, Semux will be one of few projects to survive. While we want to get viral asap, 
we can also continue staying under radars and continue waiting for our time for a very long term with a small budget for tech development only. 

## Foundation Income 
In the proposed model Semux Foundation only spends funds without any income. 
At this point Semux Foundation can maintain up to 50 validators to be a non-profit organisation with all the expenses mentioned above. 
While this has economical and legal sense, this will never happen due to dramatical impact on decentralisation. 
I'd suggest to bring back semux1-4 validators, so Semux Foundation can have some small but stable income for years ahead. 

## Founder Premine 
I'd suggest to pay to Semux Founder 25K SEM per month since the public announcement in Bitcointalk. 
In the future semux founder shall be considered no different from any other core contributor and receive monthly payments from Semux Foundation based on his monthly activity. 
Semux Project has been designed to be opensource and community-driven, so it's time to get rid of 'founder' term and move closer to contributors.

## Premine Holders
Premine shall be locked in smart contract with at least 2-of-3 multisig or better.

## Proposed Solution: budget for 2019-2021
Development: $96,000 USD per year (3-4 developers) or 480,000 SEM @ $0.20

Listings: $100,000 USD for Binance DEX or 500,000 SEM @ $0.20

Marketing: $48,000 USD per year or 240,000 SEM @ $0.20

Semux Dev Program: $100,000 USD per year ($10K per project) or 500,000 SEM @ $0.20 

Full Code Audite: $50,000 USD or 250,000 SEM @ $0.20 

Legal Entity, Lawyers, Business Consultants: $50,000 USD or 250,000 SEM @ $0.20 

Max budget per 3 years: 
3 x 0.5M for development + 0.5M for listings + 3 x 0.25M for marketing 
+ 3 x 0.5M for Semux Dev Program and Adoption + 0.25M for code audit + 0.25M for legal entity

**TOTAL: 4.75M SEM** of premine needed for the 3 years of active development. 

**TO BURN**: 18.6M - 4.75M - founder = **up to 13.85M SEM** (burn 75% of the premine)
